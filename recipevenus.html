   <h3>Caption</h3>
    <p>Venus is a cloud-swaddled planet named for a love goddess, and often called Earthâ€™s twin. But pull up a bit closer, and Venus turns hellish. Our nearest planetary neighbor, the second planet from the Sun, has a surface hot enough to melt lead. 
        The atmosphere is so thick that, from the surface, the Sun is just a smear of light.</p>
